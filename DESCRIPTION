Description: Provides elastic net regularized maximum likelihood for structural equation models (SEM) in inferring network structure (topology) and estimating causal effects. The package implements `lasso` and `elastic net` (l1/l2) penalized SEM and estimates the model parameters with an efficient block coordinate ascent algorithm that maximizes the penalized likelihood of the SEM.  Hyperparameters are inferred from cross-validation (CV).  A Stability Selection (STS) function is also available to provide accurate causal effect selection.
